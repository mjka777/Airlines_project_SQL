# Airlines_project_SQL
Analysis of Airlines in mySQL

The main objective of the project was to analyze the airline database using MySQL. This involved creating the database, setting constraints between the tables, and answering business questions using SQL. The project was part of the Code First Girls course, for which I received a certificate upon completion.
